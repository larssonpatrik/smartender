## Description of project

Smartender is an app for hobby bartenders. At the end of the project we want smartender to allow users to search for drinks, browse through categories, get a randomized drink suggestion and be able to search for drinks based on ingredients you already have at home.

## What we have done

We have finished the lay out of the app but have not added all functionality yet.
In the current verison of smartender, the user can see most popular drinks and latsest drinks on the home page and also get a randomized drink.

## What we still plan to do

We are currently working on searching for drinks by name and the advanced search, where the user will be able to search for a drink based on ingredients you have at home and be able to filter the search for example with type of glass. We are also working on connecting all drink cards on the home page to a drink details view, the same view you get from 'Randomize'. The next step we need to work on is when you click on the Vodka, Rum and Gin cards. Clicking on those cards will send the user to a view with all drinks containing that liquor. We would also like to give the users the ability to sign up/ log in and save their favourite drinks.

## Project file structure

We are working with views and presenters. Each presenter is often built up of variuos views and the views are often built up of various components. We have created our own components for heading, buttons, text bodies, cards, etc. Anything that we need to reuse many times. We also have files to handle the promise and call the API. The App.js is where we do the routing and have the structure of our app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
